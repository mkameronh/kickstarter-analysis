# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
This file contains an analysis of kickstarter campaigns with an emphasis on categories of interest paired with visual representation. In this analysis, we looked at failed vs successful US Play kickstarters and compared the stdev, IQR, mean, and median to find descriptive characteristics that could give reason behind each campaign's success or failure. We also used a box plot graph to show the distribution of GB musicals pledged amounts and goals. We also created a graph to show kickstarter outcomes overtime to see if the time of year had an effect on the success/failure of a campaign along with a graph of parent categories to see if there was a trend of success/failure among specific categories.![Outcomes Over Time - Module 1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90940985/145071468-f80d097c-4088-47f7-b576-3f8007248465.png)

Based on our findings, I would recommend Louise launch her kickstarter in May because it is the month with the most successful campaign's. I would also recommend she have a goal between $3,000-$5000. Based on the tabe "Descriptive Statistics", the failed campaigns had significantly higher goals than the successful ones, so it would be reasonable to assume that a goal within the mean and median values of successsful campaigns would have a greater chance of being successful as well.
